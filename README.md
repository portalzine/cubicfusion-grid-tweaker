## Additional Info

**Idea Behind / Philosophy:**

**cubicFUSION** is my personal playground. I planned to make many of my projects public, but time is limited and running customer projects always a priority.

I am still doing a big cleanup of my toolset and will see what I can actually share or reuse. Some of these might be useful, inspiration or just an archive of broken ideas ;)

**ENJOY!**
